An elephant is a majestic animal. It is the largest animal walking on land. It eats grass and lives in both the 
jungle and among people. The elephant is one of the most worshipped animals in the whole of Asia. It walks on 
four legs and has a long trunk useful to do a lot of things. It acts as a hand and nose combined. There are wild 
African elephants and Asian elephants. The African elephants are large and not usually tamed. In Asia, elephants 
have been tamed from centuries both for hard labour and war and worship.
